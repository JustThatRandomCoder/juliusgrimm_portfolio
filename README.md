# üöÄ My Portfolio - Open Source üéâ

Welcome to the repository of my **personal portfolio**! This project showcases my work, skills, and the technologies I use in my daily development workflow. It's not just a portfolio but also a learning resource for others to see my development process and build upon it.

> **Live Demo:** [https://beta.juliusgrimm.dev](https://beta.juliusgrimm.dev)

## üìñ About

This portfolio was built using **Vite**, **React**, and **TypeScript** to create a fast, modern, and highly customizable project.  
I've decided to make this project **open-source** so that others can get a better understanding of how I approach **frontend development** (and eventually backend tasks as I expand the project).

Feel free to explore, learn, or contribute!
